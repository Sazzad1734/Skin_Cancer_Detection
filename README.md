Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesions as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The objective is to assist healthcare professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer, thereby improving patient outcomes through timely intervention and treatment.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.
CNN Model: Utilizes a deep learning architecture specifically designed for image classification tasks.
Evaluation Metrics: Employs accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
GUI Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing skin lesion images using tkinter.
Continuous Improvement: Implements methods for model updates and improvements over time.
